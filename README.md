I'm pretty sure that this one is clean, and nice looking UI. Kudos to UK Designer once again. 🎉

## 🦄 Results

The project contains two screens given in the `screens/` directory, one for the home screen and the other for Getting Started page.

I'm aware of the change in font, but I think it's okay.
